Welcome and thanks for stopping by, I am **Hrvoje** from **Zagreb**.
After getting my degree of Associate in Applied Science in Hotel and Resort Management from Rochester Institute of Technology, I have built a successful career in Sales and other departments in major Zagreb hotels. Now the time has come for a major career turn and entering the world of IT. I have finished Algebra University Frontend Program (https://www.algebra.hr/en/) and I am completely passionate about frontend development.


I love building cool, interesting websites or tools for fun and for learning, using Javascript or React, CSS and HTML.

                                                         More About Me
I am a very positive and open minded person. My coworkers find me reliable and pleasant to be around. My daily routine includes sports, exercise and fine meals. Running is my great passion that keeps me healthy and my mind sharp. Best ideas come to me while I am running. 
Nowadays I play chess for a bit of relaxing, and as brain gym but back in the days I used to be a captain of a chess club in croatian league. I am excellent at logic and a great problem solver.
This is my 4-step framework to solve any problem:

<ol>
    <li>Make sure to understand the problem 100% and ask the right questions to get a clear pic of the problem./li>
    <li>Divide and conquer. Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems./li>
    <li>Do as much research as I have to do.</li>
    <li>For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing actual code.</li>
  </ol>
I love meeting new people and learning new things, so please feel free to say hello and share a story with me.
